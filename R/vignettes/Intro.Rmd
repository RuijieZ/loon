# All pairs

A `zenplot` can show the same information as a `pairs` plot but with two important display differences.

First, the matrix organization of the `pairs` layout is replaced by the ``zig-zag'' layout of `zenplot`.  Second, the number of plots produced is about half that of a `pairs` plot allowing each plot in a `zenplot` to be given more visual space.
