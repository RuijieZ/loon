#' @details 
#' Canvas bindings are used to evaluate callbacks at certain X events on the 
#' canvas widget (underlying widget for all of loon's plot widgets). Such X
#' events include re-sizing of the canvas and entering the canvas with the
#' mouse.
#' 
#' Bindings, Callbacks, Canvas Bindings, and binding substitutions are described
#' in detail in loon's documentation webpage, i.e. run
#' \code{l_help("learn_R_bind")}.
